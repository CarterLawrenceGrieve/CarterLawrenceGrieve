- 👋 Hi, I’m @CarterLawrenceGrieve
- 👀 I’m interested in mystery novels, dungeons and dragons, and programming of all sorts - largely backend development and data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more backend developpment - I need to brush up on C: plus plus, sharp, flat, and otherwise.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cool statistics, bits of software, and anything in python!
- 📫 How to reach me: shoot an email to carterlawrencegrieve@gmail.com!
